## CSC 580: Principles of Machine Learning (Fall 2022)

Students will learn why machine learning is a fundamentally different way of writing computer programs from traditional programming, 
and why this is often an attractive way of solving practical problems. 
Machine learning is about automatic ways for computers to collect and/or adapt to data to make predictions, make decisions, or gain insight; 
students will learn both advantages and unique risks that this approach offers. 
They will learn the fundamental frameworks, computational methods, 
and algorithms that underlie current machine learning practice, and how to derive and implement many of them.

We will be using Piazza to make important announcements and do Q&As. Some general rules:

* If you have technical questions, try posing your questions as general as possible, to promote discussions among the class.
* If you have private questions, generally please make a private Piazza post instead of sending me an email - This will help facilitate my processing of your requests significantly.

We recommended the following texts for optional reading:

Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David, [Understanding machine learning: from theory to algorithms](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/) 

Moritz Hardt and Benjamin Recht, [Patterns, predictions, and actions: Foundations of machine learning](https://mlstory.org/)

Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman, The elements of statistical learning (2nd edition).

Tom Mitchell, Machine Learning.

Kevin Murphy, Machine learning: a probabilistic perspective.

Richard Duda, Peter Hart, and David Stork, Pattern classification (2nd edition).


### Review for prerequisites

Here are some excellent notes for [probability review](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf) and [linear algebra review](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf) from Stanford's CS 229 course.

See also [The matrix cookbook](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf), [The Probability and Statistics Cookbook](http://statistics.zone/), and [Calculus cheatsheet](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/pdf/calculus_cheat_sheet_all.pdf) (recommended by Prof. Kwang-Sung Jun).


### LaTeX

You may find using LaTeX helpful in writing homeworks or reports. Some useful LaTeX resources: [Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes by Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes#Adding_math_to_LaTeX); [Introduction to LATEX by MIT Research Science Institute](http://web.mit.edu/rsi/www/pdfs/new-latex.pdf)
