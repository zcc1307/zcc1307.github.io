To prospective PhD students: I am mostly looking for self-motivated students with solid math and programming background 
/ theoretical research experience. Due to the sheer volume of emails I receive every day, 
I may not be able to respond to your emails one by one. But please do not be discouraged -- if you are interested in working with me, 
you are very welcome to apply to University of Arizona's <a href="https://www.cs.arizona.edu/graduate/prospective-students">CS</a> 
or <a href="https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/admissions/application-procedures">Applied Math</a>, 
or <a href="https://statistics.arizona.edu/admissions">Statistics</a> PhD programs. Best of luck!
