<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
Hello! I am an assistant professor at the
<a href="https://www.cs.arizona.edu/">Computer Science Department</a>,
<a href="https://www.arizona.edu/">the University of Arizona</a>.
From September 2017 to June 2019, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the machine learning group of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/">Microsoft Research NYC</a>.
I got my PhD in Computer Science at UCSD, where I was lucky to have Prof. <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/%7Ekamalika/">Kamalika Chaudhuri</a> as my advisor. Before this, I was an undergraduate student at Peking University, studying learning theory with Prof. <a href="http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/">Liwei Wang</a>.

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>
My research interests lie in theory and applications of machine
learning. I primarily work on interactive machine learning, including but not restricted to:
  <ul>
  <li>active learning,</li>
  <li>contextual bandits,</li>
  <li>reinforcement learning,</li>
  <li>imitation learning,</li>
</ul>
where learning agents take an active role in data collection processes and perform inference, prediction, and decision making. Specifically, I am interested in:
<ul>
  <li>designing and analyzing interactive learning algorithms that have data-efficiency, computational efficiency, and
  robustness guarantees, as well as,</li>
  <li>identifying new and natural interaction mechanisms learning agents can benefit from.</li>
</ul>
