### CSC 665 Section 2: Machine Learning Theory - Fall 2019

Designed mainly as a more theoretically-oriented version of [CSC 580 Principles of Machine Learning](https://cscheid.net/courses/spr19/csc665/), students will learn, via the lens of mathematical foundations, how and when machine learning is possible/impossible as well as various algorithms with theoretical guarantees. Specifically, the course offers mathematical formulation of learning environments (e.g., stochastic and adversarial worlds with possibly limited feedback), fundamental limits of learning in these environments, various algorithms concerning sample efficiency, computational efficiency, and generality. Throughout, students will not only learn fundamental mathematical tools upholding the current understanding of machine learning systems in the research community but also develop skills of adapting these techniques to their own research needs such as developing new algorithms.
