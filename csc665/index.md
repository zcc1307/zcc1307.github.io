### CSC 665 Section 2: Machine Learning Theory - Fall 2019

Designed mainly as a more theoretically-oriented version of [CSC 580 Principles of Machine Learning](https://cscheid.net/courses/spr19/csc665/), students will learn, via the lens of mathematical foundations, how and when machine learning is possible/impossible as well as various algorithms with theoretical guarantees. Specifically, the course offers mathematical formulation of learning environments (e.g., stochastic and adversarial worlds with possibly limited feedback), fundamental limits of learning in these environments, various algorithms concerning sample efficiency, computational efficiency, and generality. Throughout, students will not only learn fundamental mathematical tools upholding the current understanding of machine learning systems in the research community but also develop skills of adapting these techniques to their own research needs such as developing new algorithms.

#### Textbook

There is no designated textbook for this course. Much of the course
materials will be based on the following books (in the order of appearance
  in class schedule):

[Understanding machine learning: from theory to algorithms](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/) by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David (SSBD)

[Introduction to online optimization](https://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/OCObook.pdf) by Elad Hazan (H)

[Bandit algorithms](https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf) by Tor Lattimore and Csaba Szepesvari (LS)

The following set of surveys and books also provide a good coverage of relevant materials:

[Online learning and online convex optimization](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/papers/OLsurvey.pdf) by Shai Shalev-Shwartz

[Regret analysis of stochastic and nonstochastic multi-armed bandit problems](http://sbubeck.com/SurveyBCB12.pdf) by Sebastien Bubeck and Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi

[Introduction to Multi-Armed Bandits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07272.pdf) by Alex Slivkins

#### Review for prerequisites
