            <h3 id="csc-665-section-2-machine-learning-theory-syllabus">CSC 665 Section 2: Machine Learning Theory: Syllabus</h3>
<h4 id="description-of-course">Description of Course</h4>
<p>Designed mainly as an advanced (and more theoretically-oriented) version of CSC665 Principles of Machine Learning, students will learn, via the lens of mathematical foundations, how and when machine learning is possible/impossible as well as various algorithms with theoretical guarantees. Specifically, the course offers mathematical formulation of learning environments (e.g., stochastic and adversarial worlds with possibly limited feedback), fundamental limits of learning in these environments, various algorithms concerning sample efficiency, computational efficiency, and generality. Throughout, students will not only learn fundamental mathematical tools upholding the current understanding of machine learning systems in the research community but also develop skills of adapting these techniques to their own research needs such as developing new algorithms.</p>
<h4 id="course-prerequisites-or-co-requisites">Course Prerequisites or Co-requisites</h4>
<p>Linear Algebra or equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You will need to understand the relationship between linear operators, linear transformations, and matrices</p></li>
<li><p>We will make repeated use of matrix decompositions such as the SVD</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Multivariate Calculus or equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will need to understand the relationship between the total derivative, the gradient, and how to take advantage of the fact that the derivative is a linear operator</li>
</ul>
<p>Basic probability theory and statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You will need to understand (conditional) expectation and (conditional) independence of random variables.</p></li>
<li><p>You will need to have basic concepts on concentration of measures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will need a basic programming skills for math such as matlab, julia, or python with numpy/scipy.</p>

<p>Office hour: TBD; The instructor is also available by appointment.</p>
<p>D2L: <a href="https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/home/824748" class="uri">https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/home/824748</a></p>
<h4 id="course-format-and-teaching-methods">Course Format and Teaching Methods</h4>
<p>Lectures, individual assignments, written exams, projects, in-class discussions.</p>
<h4 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h4>
<p>A successful student will be able to explain the key learning theory concepts and analyze the lower and upper bounds of various machine learning tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>PAC learning model</li>
<li>VC dimension, Rademacher complexity</li>
<li>Sample complexity bounds for finite classes and linear functions</li>
<li>Boosting</li>
<li>Support vector machine</li>
<li>PAC-Bayes bounds, stability bounds</li>
<li>Online classification and mistake bounds</li>
<li>Online convex optimization, follow the regularized leader, online mirror descent.</li>
<li>Online-to-batch conversion</li>
<li>Online learning with limited feedback (multi-armed bandits)</li>
</ul>
<p>For a more granular description of the learning objectives, see the week-by-week schedule and the description of the assignments below.</p>
<p>This course is far from a complete survey of the concurrent topics on machine learning theory due to the sheer volume of recent developments and the fact that those topics require a deep understanding of concepts and fluency in mathematical techniques. That said, this course covers key topics that not only serve as building blocks of advanced machine learning theory but is also relevant in modern research so that the students can directly adapt learned topics to their own research. Students are expected to dedicate a significant amount of time on understanding mathematical concepts and skills outside the classroom.</p>
<h4 id="expected-learning-outcomes">Expected Learning Outcomes</h4>
<p>The expected learning outcomes of the course are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To be able to identify the factors that affect the performance of learning algorithms, including label noise, approximation error, optimization error, generalization error</li>
<li>To be able to establish concentration between training and test losses by uniform convergence theory</li>
<li>To be able to explain how the complexity/size of the hypothesis class can affect an algorithm’s generalization performance.</li>
<li>To be able to explain overfitting/underfitting in mathematical language, and use the theory of structural risk minimization to perform model selection</li>
<li>To be able to explain the role of margins in learning theory</li>
<li>To be able to explain the difference between follow the regularized leader and online mirror descent, and derive basic regret guarantees of the two types of algorithms</li>
<li>To be able to derive generalization bounds from online learning</li>
<li>To be able to analyze optimization errors of learning algorithms, such as boosting and SVM</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="scheduled-topicsactivities">Scheduled Topics/Activities</h4>
<p>See <a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a> page for details.</p>
<h4 id="department-of-computer-science-code-of-conduct">Department of Computer Science Code of Conduct</h4>
<p>The Department of Computer Science is committed to providing and maintaining a supportive educational environment for all. We strive to be welcoming and inclusive, respect privacy and confidentiality, behave respectfully and courteously, and practice intellectual honesty. Disruptive behaviors (such as physical or emotional harassment, dismissive attitudes, and abuse of department resources) will not be tolerated. The complete Code of Conduct is available on our department web site. We expect that you will adhere to this code, as well as the UA Student Code of Conduct, while you are a member of this class.</p>
<h4 id="classroom-behavior-policy">Classroom Behavior Policy</h4>
<p>To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.). Students are asked to refrain from disruptive conversations with people sitting around them during lecture. Students observed engaging in disruptive activity will be asked to cease this behavior. Those who continue to disrupt the class will be asked to leave lecture or discussion and may be reported to the Dean of Students. Some learning styles are best served by using personal electronics, such as laptops and iPads. These devices can be distracting to other learners. Therefore, students who prefer to use electronic devices for note-taking during lecture should use one side of the classroom.</p>
<h4 id="threatening-behavior-policy">Threatening Behavior Policy</h4>
<p>The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the University community, including to oneself. See <a href="http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students" class="uri">http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students</a>.</p>
