## Research

My research is on interactive machine learning, where learning agents actively engage in data collection to make decisions or gain useful insights. Such interactive nature of learning
processes enables learning agents to focus on collecting data from the relevant parts of the environment, thus allowing to save data collection effort (which oftentimes translates to 
onerous human labor or experimental cost). To this end, I study principled designs of interactive machine learning algorithms with efficiency guarantees (e.g. sample efficiency, 
computational efficiency), and evaluate them experimentally in simulated and real-world datasets and environments. Some research topics I have been working on: 

### Imitation Learning

Imitation learning, or Learning from Demonstrations, models the setting where a learning agent learns from a demonstrating expert to obtain intelligent sequential decision making behavior. 
Compared with reinforcement learning, imitation learning has the advantages that: (1) it gets around the reward misspecification problem and (2) it can mitigate the challenge 
of exploration. Such paradigm has been successfully deployed in e.g. robotics and autonomous driving. My research in imitation learning has been focused on understanding the power 
of interactive expert demonstrations: if we have an human expert that can provide real-time, interactive action demonstration (as opposed to just offline demonstration trajectories), 
how can we best utilize it to save its demonstration effort?
