## CSC 480/580: Principles of Machine Learning (Spring 2024)

Machine learning is about automatic ways for computers to collect and/or adapt 
to data to make predictions, make decisions, or gain insight. 
It can also be seen as a fundamentally different way of writing computer programs 
from traditional programming, which is often an attractive way of solving practical problems. 
Students will learn the fundamental frameworks, computational methods, 
and algorithms that underlie current machine learning practice, and how to derive 
and implement many of them. 
They will also learn both advantages and unique risks that this approach offers.

[Piazza link](https://piazza.com/arizona/spring2024/csc480580); Access Code: 285esihd06d 

Gradescope: [480](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/699668) entry code: B2DGGG, [580](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/699666) entry code: NPNZZ5

We will be using Piazza to make important announcements and do Q&As. Some general rules:

* If you have technical questions, try posing your questions as general as possible, to promote discussions among the class.
* We will not answer private Piazza posts that seek to check the correctness of (partial) solutions. 
You are welcome to come to office hours to discuss them.

Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville, [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David, [Understanding machine learning: from theory to algorithms](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/) 

Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman, The elements of statistical learning (2nd edition).

Tom Mitchell, Machine Learning.

Kevin Murphy, Machine learning: a probabilistic perspective.

Richard Duda, Peter Hart, and David Stork, Pattern classification (2nd edition).


### Review for prerequisites

Here are some excellent notes for [probability review](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf) and [linear algebra review](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf) from Stanford's CS 229 course.

See also [The matrix cookbook](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf), [The Probability and Statistics Cookbook](http://statistics.zone/), and [Calculus cheatsheet](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/pdf/calculus_cheat_sheet_all.pdf) (recommended by Prof. Kwang-Sung Jun).


### LaTeX

You may find using LaTeX helpful in writing homeworks or reports. 
Some useful LaTeX resources: 
[Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes by Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes#Adding_math_to_LaTeX); 
[Introduction to LaTeX by MIT Research Science Institute](http://web.mit.edu/rsi/www/pdfs/new-latex.pdf)


### Generative AI use

In this course, generative artificial intelligence/large-language-models tools, such as ChatGPT, Dall-e,
Bard, Bing, may be used for assignments with appropriate acknowledgment and
citation. However, the use of LLMs is **only limited to polishing and refining**, 
not for generating entire pieces of writing.
All submitted assignments must be the original work of the student. Specifically, 
you are responsible for checking facts, finding reliable sources for, and making a careful, critical
examination of any work that you submit; you should be comfortable to explain any information 
in your submission.

If you are in doubt as to whether you are using
generative AI tools appropriately in this course, I encourage you to discuss your situation with me.
Be aware that many AI companies collect information; do not enter confidential information as part
of a prompt. LLMs may make up or hallucinate information. These tools may reflect misconceptions
and biases of the data on which they were trained and the human-written prompts used to steer
them.
