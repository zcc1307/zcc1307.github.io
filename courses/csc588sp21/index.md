## CSC 588: Machine Learning Theory (Spring 2021)

This course provides an introduction to the theoretical aspects of machine learning. Students will
learn how and when machine learning is possible/impossible as well as various algorithms with
theoretical guarantees under minimal assumptions. Specifically, the course offers formulation of
learning environments (e.g., batch and online settings, stochastic and adversarial worlds with possibly limited feedback),
fundamental limits of learning in these environments, various algorithms concerning sample
efficiency, computational efficiency, and generality. Throughout, students will not only learn
fundamental tools upholding the current understanding of machine learning systems in the research
community but also develop skills of adapting these techniques to their own research needs such as
developing new algorithms for large-scale, data-driven applications.
